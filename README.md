Well , it's all over we will never receive any major upgrades except regular security updates from nokia So from now there is a protocol to us especially for 6.1+ implemented by me to resize everyone's phone to 3.5GB system and 1gb vendor atlast Finally this really helps us to install  custom roms/GSIs which has 3gb+ system.img  


    1. Download Nokia-Repartition-Tool.zip & open Nokia-Repartition-Tool.exe

    2. Select whatever size you want and click on it

    G = GB
    S = system
    V = vendor

    3. Now automatically your phone reboots to twrp and install whatever you want 😊👍😁
